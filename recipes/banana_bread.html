            <li>One and a half teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>One fourth teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Half a cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Three teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Three eggs</li>
            <li>Three very ripe bananas</li>
            <li>Can of spray oil</li>
            <li>[optional] A tablespoon of cinnamon</li>
            <li>[optional] Half a cup chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get all of your ingredients out, along with two large bowls and a small cake pan</li>
            <li>Begin pouring the sugar, flower, and all the other dry ingredients into one bowl</li>
            <li>Do the same for the other bowl with the bananas, eggs and the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>With a rubber spatula, or whisk, begin to break apart the bananas and mix it together with the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Once you've thouroghly mixed the wet ingredients together, pour them out into the bowl of dry ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix well until its all a thick runny dough. If it becomes too hard to mix add a small bit of water and continue mixing.</li>
            <li>Now, spray the whole surface inside of the cake pan and pour the batter into it.</li>
            <li>Set the oven to 350F and put the pan in on the middle tray</li>
            <li>Let cook for roughly 50 minutes. After 50 minutes check if the inside is done by poking a toothpick into the top of the loaf</li>
            <p>If dough is stuck to the toothpick then leave the loaf in the oven and repeat in two minutes untill the toothpick comes out dry</p>
            <li>Let the pan rest on your stovetop for 10 minutes, then enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Storing Instructions</h3>
        <p>There are 3 different ways you can store this bread.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You put plastic wrap snuggly over the top and poke in a few holes with a toothpick. Store on your countertop or in your cabinet.</li>
            <p>-This will soften the crust of the bread while keeping the whole thing slightly moist, and more importantly, yummy.</p>
            <li>Put a kitchen towel over the top and rest on countertop or in cabinet.</li>
            <p>-This will keep the crust of the bread from getting softer but will also dry out the rest of the loaf.</p>
            <li>Lastly, put tin foil over the top.</li>
            <p>-This keeps the crust the crispest while also keeping the rest of the loaf moist.</p>
        </ol>
